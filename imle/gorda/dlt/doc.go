/*
Package dlt : The Gorda DLT (Distributed Ledger Tech)
Gorda closely follows the Corda design.
However, Gorda is implemented in go. Also, aims to support
pluggable VM for contracts & flows as well as pluggable P2P communication
protocols.

Gorda (like Corda), follows the UXTO (Unspent Transaction Output) model rather than Ethereum like Account ledger model.

The P2P transport & the payload are pluggable
